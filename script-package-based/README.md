# Bitnami Jenkins

The Bitnami Jenkins Stack provides a one-click install solution for
Jenkins. Download installers and virtual machines, or run your own
Jenkins server in the cloud.

Ask a room of developers which CI system they're using and there is a
good chance that several, if not most, will say Jenkins. Not wanting
to see their favorite CI subsumed by Oracle, Jenkins was spun out in
2011 as its own product. It's widely recognized as the most
feature-rich CI available with easy configuration, continuous delivery
and continuous integration support, easily test, build and stage your
app, and more. It supports multiple SCM tools including CVS,
Subversion and Git. It can execute Apache Ant and Apache Maven-based
projects as well as arbitrary scripts. Out of the box, the Bitnami
Jenkins package includes Jenkins, Apache, Tomcat, and Git.
